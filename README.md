Smart alarm clock app


I want to create a smart alarm clock that can be turned off after solving tasks (solving simple examples, writing various phrases, etc.). The application will have user accounts with personal wake-up statistics and synchronization between devices with the same account.

Milestones:
1. Create main UI pages for login page, alarm list and alarm settings
2. Create database for storing accounts info
3. Create database for synchronizing alarms between devices
4. Write code for functionality
5. Connect databases
